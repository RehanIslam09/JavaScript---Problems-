        var a = 10;
        Explain why.

  ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Creation Phase (Hoisting)
        The engine scans through the code and hoists declarations (not initializations).
        For variables declared with var, only the declaration is hoisted â€” not the value.
   ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Execution Phase
        Now, line by line:
        console.log(a) â†’ a exists but has value undefined
        Then a = 10 runs, assigning 10 to a
        âš¡ Therefore
        Output = undefined
